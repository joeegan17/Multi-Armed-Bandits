I wrote this code in Python 3.10.6 in VSCode with a Jupyter notebooks layout.

packages are:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn

Two classes -- Action and Agent
for each run, I created a list that holds 10 Actions
the Agent uses its methods to interact with the Actions
there are several arrays to store data for each run
1. Initialize Agent and create empty arrays
2. create list of Actions
3. Run simulation
4. create meta arrays of averages and counts for graphing/comparisons
5. Graphs

This repeats several times for each Agent type/methods/experiment

At the end I put together a few data tables to make charts for the write up
